Presently, our developments are centered in the RSK.sage file which handles the following functions (among others):
1. Converting from a matrix to a plane partition
2. Converting from a plane partition to a matrix
For any given matrix-plane partition pair, we display the matrix, the two resulting SSYT's, and the resulting plane partition, both in conventional box notation, and a 3-D representation.  Some examples have been provided (see pdfs).
